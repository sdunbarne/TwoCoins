# TwoCoins
LaTeX files and auxiliaries for section on algorithms distinguishing fair from biased coins

1.      How to numerically compute the probability of a majority of
        heads in a sequence of paired coin flips of a biased coin and a
        fair coin.
2.      How to numerically compute the probability of statistical
        evidence of a biased coin in a sequence of paired coin flips of
        a biased coin and a fair coin.
3.      Bayesian analysis using likelihood ratios as statistical
        evidence of a biased coin in a sequence of paired coin flips of
        a biased coin and a fair coin.
4.        A theoretical analysis using probabilistic inequalities shows a
        necessary and sufficient number of flips is of the order \( (p-1/2)^
        {-2} \).
